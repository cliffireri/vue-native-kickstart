# Vue Native Kickstart

Most of the Vue-Native apps I could find were too simple to be a
launching point for a production app. 

Choices:

* Vue-Native
* NativeBase Components
* GraphQL storage
* AWS Amplify backend

Full disclaimer: I am an experienced engineer but am learning
Vue-Native as I build this out.
